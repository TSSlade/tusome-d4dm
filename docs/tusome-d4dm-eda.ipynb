These pupils are then provided a stimulus that contains a brief reading passage of ~50-100 words. As they read aloud from the stimulus, the CSO uses the _Tangerine_ application on the tablet to make note of any inaccurately read words. When the child has finished reading - or when 60 seconds elapses, whichever comes first - the assessment is complete. The child's fluency is then calculated using the formula\n",
