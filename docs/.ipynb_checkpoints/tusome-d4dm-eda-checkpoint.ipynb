    "The ultimate goal of Tusome is to improve reading outcomes in grades 1-3.

    "For a CSO's visit to be considered _complete_ or _valid_, one of the criteria is that it include an assessment of the reading skills of three randomly-selected pupils. These pupils are then provided a stimulus that contains a brief reading passage of ~50-100 words. As they read aloud from the stimulus, the CSO uses the _Tangerine_ application on the tablet to make note of any inaccurately read words. When the child has finished reading - or when 60 seconds elapses, whichever comes first - the assessment is complete. The child's fluency is then calculated using the formula\n",

This is in keeping with the beginning of the Tusome program, and is as expected. CSOs who have had their tablets for longer are likely veterans of the PRIMR program (Tusome's predecessor); those who have had tablets for fewer months may have assumed their roles more recently. (CSO turnover due to retirement, promotion, maternity leave, etc. is an issue which Tusome is constantly needing to manage.)"
