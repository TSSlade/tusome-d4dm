The underlying assumption of most of the interview protocol is that the
teacher has had a coaching interaction with a CSO. The first issue we
should then address is the proportion of teachers who have received a
visit from a CSO.

    We see that 7.37\% of teachers interviewed had never been previously
visited by CSOs.

\subsubsection{Number of coaching visits in the last academic

We have confirmed that the overwhelming majority of our teachers have
been visited. We can have greater confidence in the responses they give
us over the course of the interview if they have had a visit in the
recent past. We therefore asked the teachers to tell us how many times
they had been visited by their CSO in the preceding academic term (Term
2 of the Kenyan academic year, running from roughly May-July 2018).

    We see that roughly 11\% of the respondents, while they'd been visited
by a CSO in the past, had not been visited in the preceding term.
However, roughly 64\% of the respondents were visited between once per
term and once per month. Roughly 28\% of the teachers were visited by
their CSOs more frequently than monthly.

\subsubsection{CSOs' activities during last coaching
visit}\label{csos-activities-during-last-coaching-visit}}

We are interested in knowing what CSOs are focusing on when they pay a
visit to a school. Are they observing a lesson? Are they giving feedback
to the teacher? Do they assess pupils' fluency rates? Do they take
advantage of their presence at the school to meet with the head teacher
(HT)? What kinds of things are they doing \emph{besides} these
activities?

\end{figure}

    Nearly 90\% of teachers report that when the CSO last visited, s/he
provided feedback on a lesson. A fairly comparable proportion said that
the CSO assessed pupils. Neither of these is surprising, as those
activities are key features of a ``reimbursable'' or ``valid'' lesson
observation. If anything, it is interesting that these numbers are not
higher, given that we have excluded from our denominator those teachers
who said they had never received a visit from the CSO.

Of note is the relatively low proportion of teachers reporting the CSO
had spoken with the HT. While Tusome encourages CSOs to speak with HTs
as part of the standard protocol for visiting a school, it is not
explicitly considered as a factor for reimbursement of transportation
costs for visiting that school.

That said, it is also possible that teachers may simply not be aware of
activities taking place outside of their classroom. They and their
classrooms would have been the objects of the lesson observation and
fluency assessment; they may not have as much visibility into what
happened before or after the CSO entered their classroom.

A little over 15\% of teachers reported the CSO conducted an activity
that was not listed in the questionnaire. Below we have sampled 20 of
the things that they reported which were not captured in the
questionnaire.

\subsubsection{CSOs using tablets or pen \& paper during
observation}\label{csos-using-tablets-or-pen-paper-during-observation}}

The \emph{Tangerine:Tutor} app was developed with the intent and belief
that CSOs would use it \emph{while observing} the lesson. However,
Tusome staff report that not all CSOs find the tablet interface
comfortable, and not all use it with ease. So we asked teachers to
report whether CSOs use the tablets during the lesson observation, and
also whether they use pen and paper.

    Roughly 90\% of teachers reported that the CSOs use tablets during
lesson observation; roughly 81\% of teachers reported the CSOs use pen
and paper during the lesson observation.

    We see that the overwhelming majority of CSOs are using both tablets
\emph{and} pen-and-paper systems when observing the teachers' lesson.
There have historically been some instruments/data that CSOs were tasked
by TSC to complete that were not rendered in \emph{Tangerine} format on
the tablets; as of midway through Term 3 of the 2018 academic year,
those instruments (mostly for the TSC's TPAD {[}Teacher Performance
Appraisal and Development{]} project) are now in \emph{Tangerine}. While
the use of pen and paper does not appear to have come at the expense of
using the tablets - indeed, it appears to be complementary, as nearly
all CSOs are using both - Tusome should nonetheless follow up on these
reports of CSOs' usage of pen and paper to understand the roots of the
practice.

\subsubsection{CSOs' usage of the tablets to assess pupils'
performance}\label{csos-usage-of-the-tablets-to-assess-pupils-performance}}

Tusome's coaching protocol requires CSOs to randomly select three
children from the classroom at the end of the lesson to assess their
reading fluency. The prompt the children are to read from is a laminated
sheet of paper with a short passage printed on it; the CSOs are
instructed to use the tablet to record the children's responses. The
tablet is then able to calculate fluency rates and store those as data
associated with that observation.

Approximately 88\% of the teachers reported that CSOs use the tablets to
assess children's reading fluency.

\subsubsection{Teachers' experience of feedback, and CSOs' use of

Tusome asked teachers whether the CSO gave feedback on the lesson last
time s/he paid a visit, whether s/he used the tablet to do so, and
whether the teacher was able to recall specific feedback the CSO
provided.

    The tablets come equipped with various aids that CSOs could use to help
coach teachers. In addition to the contents of the auto-generated
feedback, CSOs could use the \emph{Papaya} application to model
pronunciation of letter sounds, the videos demonstrating effective
lesson delivery, etc. Of the teachers reporting CSOs provided feedback
of some kind, 56\% indicated that the CSO showed them something directly
on the tablet.

    Overall, fewer than 50\% of teachers indicated that CSOs showed them
something on the tablet as part of the feedback session. Where the CSO
showed something to the teacher, it was most frequently pupils' reading
fluency (at 35\%), with Papaya letter sounds the next most common (at
31\%).

\subsubsection{CSOs' use of feedback

Tusome's theory of change stipulates that smaller, more frequent, and
more targeted coaching interactions will shift teacher behavior more
effectively than larger-scale, episodic training events that cover a
broad range of topics. This is the reason Tusome invests so heavily in
supporting CSOs to provide coaching support to teachers in the span
between large-scale training events.

Teachers, like most people, will be more likely to alter their behavior
if feedback is timely and consistent, and the teachers' response to it
is monitored rather than assumed. In this survey, roughly 63\% of
teachers indicated that when CSOs visited the school and observed the
teacher, they follow up on feedback from earlier visits.

Effectively measuring the quality of instruction or lesson delivery is a
very, very difficult task. (\textbf{T.D.}: { Provide citations, examples
of various approaches.})

The current study was not able to directly assess the quality of
teachers' lesson delivery, although Tusome is working on various other
studies which attempt to do so. However, we asked teachers whether they
felt the coaching received from CSOs had improved the quality of their
teaching. We first posed the question in regard to the teaching of
reading in Kiswahili and English, and then asked them whether the
coaching had improved their teaching in other subjects as well.

\subsubsection{CSOs' discussion of pupil
fluency}\label{csos-discussion-of-pupil-fluency}}

The ultimate goal of Tusome is to improve reading outcomes in grades
1-3. Whether the project has been successful is determined by the
pupils' reading skills (with an emphasis on \emph{oral reading fluency},
or ORF, and reading comprehension) as demonstrated by their performance
on an early grade reading assessment (EGRA).

For a CSO's visit to be considered \emph{complete} or \emph{valid}, one
of the criteria is that it include an assessment of the reading skills
of three randomly-selected pupils. These pupils are then provided a
stimulus that contains a brief reading passage of
\textasciitilde{}50-100 words. As they read aloud from the stimulus, the
CSO uses the \emph{Tangerine} application on the tablet to make note of
any inaccurately read words. When the child has finished reading - or
when 60 seconds elapses, whichever comes first - the assessment is
complete. The child's fluency is then calculated using the formula

\[\frac{\text{\# of correct words}}{\big(\frac{60 \ - \ \text{time remaining (s)}}{60}\big)} = \text{correct words per minute}\]

The \emph{Tangerine} software calculates the average fluency in
\emph{cwpm} across all three pupils and reports it as part of the lesson
feedback. The CSO is able - but not required - to bring up the pupils'
fluency as part of their feedback session.

pupils' fluency with the teachers, and the teachers overwhelmingly
(92.57\%) find it a useful discussion. But how do teachers make use of
that insight?

\subsubsection{Disruption caused by tablet
use}\label{disruption-caused-by-tablet-use}}

Pupils are easily distracted by the presence of unfamiliar adults in the
classroom. However, if the adult sits quietly and unobtrusively in the
rear of the classroom, the children rapidly become acclimated to the
visitor's presence and are able to focus on the lesson.

For many children in rural schools, however, tablet computers are an
unfamiliar sight. Tusome was interested to know whether the CSOs' use of
tablets to conduct the classroom observation or assess the pupils'
fluency is perceived as disruptive.

tablet use distracting; because the numbers are so low, the lists below
present all responses rather than just a sample.

1      Pupils get attention of the tablet                                                                                                                                                          
13     at times it is distracting when the CSO takes a photo using the tablet. This mostly affects the pupils. It was a challenge to me the first time she took the photos but now I am used to it.
26     some learners look at the CSO at the back of the class as he he uses tablet hence distracting their attention                                                                               
47     The curious one always keep on looking at the tablet instead of listening to me                                                                                                             
89     Some of the children sitting next to the children get distraccted and stop looking and the board.They are are also not comfortable because they are not used to it.

132    Because the pupils keep on looking at the CSO and not the teacher when am teaching

224    Sometimes the learners try to look behind but i control them.

278    Pupils are glued to the tablet.                                                                                                                                                             
284    The kids concentrate on the tablet                                                                                                                                                          
297    My pupils are eager to find out what the CSO is keying in the tablet                                                                                                                        
298    My pupils would be interested to know more about the tablet and hence poor concentration during the lesson

596    Some pupils tend to concetrate at the CSO using the tablets behind the class while am teaching in class                                                                                     
625    Sometimes my learners become interested in what the CSO is doing                                                                                                                            
654    It creates curiosit to my learners                                                                                                                                                          
676    sometimes the learners turn to see what the CSo is doing, for me its not                                                                                                                    
728    The table diverts the learners attention and they will not concentrate on the lesson i am teaching                                                                                          
774    This is because i have a class of 71 learners and the ones who were near the CSO, were being distracted by the CSO's tablet. Majority of the learners were OK

35     it arouses curiosity therefore disrupt concentration of the learners                                                                                                                                                                                                         
50     I am distracted because i don't know what he will tell me                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
176    Because i am not aware what he is doing with the tablet but if both are looking at it, i will not find it distracting                                                                                                                                                        
206    My thinking is that the CSO is recording me and can be used in other places                                                                                                                                                                                                  
241    When he is giving me feedback find it distracting that the CSO has to keep on looking on the tablet, I wonder what he is looking at or reading from the tablet. I prefer that he uses a a hardcopy of a real book not from his tablet since i cant see what he is looking at.

    While these results are encouraging, it may be that CSOs' tablet use is
more distracting when it is the pupils themselves who are the object of
the CSO's attention. We asked teachers whether they were present during
the assessment of pupils' reading skills, and if so, whether it was
their sense that pupils were distracted by the tablet use.

    Roughly 59\% of the teachers said they had observed the CSO's assessment
of the pupils' reading skills. Of those, 22\% thought the pupils found
the tablet distracting. This may suggest a need for Tusome to provide
additional training or orientation to CSOs on best practices in
assessment administration.

Below we sample 20 of the reasons teachers provided for why they thought
pupils found tablet use distracting during the assessment.

244    The pupils were getting distraced initailly because they would focus on the tablet but now they are used . The stmulus doesn't look like a book, is it possible to print it like a book which the pupils are used to.
212    Because most of them tend not to concentrate on what they are reading and get themselves looking at the tablet.

202    The learner is used to reading on paper, so when the CSO asked them to read on the tablet it was distracting because this is not what they are used to.

\subsubsection{Teachers' ongoing assessment of pupil
fluency}\label{teachers-ongoing-assessment-of-pupil-fluency}}

Teachers are fully capable of assessing their pupils' reading fluency
without recourse to a tablet. However, RTI has experimented with an
Android-based pupil performance tracking tool that might be of use to
teachers. Therefore we were interested to understand the extent to which
teachers are already assessing pupils' fluency, what tools they are
using for the task, whether they have access to phones on which such a
tool could be deployed, and whether they would want to use it if so.

\emph{When did you first receive a tablet from Tusome or PRIMR?}

We want to convert the year/month CSOs provided into a number so we can
work with it easily. We'll make the simplifying assumption that the
tablet was received on the first day of the month they provided, and
that this interview was conducted on the first day of the month. Neither
of those are true, but the marginal days are unlikely to make a
practical difference in a CSO's facility with the tool.

    We see that the majority of our CSOs have had their tablets for roughly
41 months (3.5 years). This is in keeping with the beginning of the
Tusome program, and is as expected. CSOs who have had their tablets for
longer are likely veterans of the PRIMR program (Tusome's predecessor);
those who have had tablets for fewer months may have assumed their roles
more recently. (CSO turnover due to retirement, promotion, maternity
leave, etc. is an issue which Tusome is constantly needing to manage.)

instructional delivery.

We are interested in which of those tools CSOs use, and how frequently.

The \emph{Tangerine:Tutor} application analyzes the pattern of the CSO's
responses to the observation items and surfaces actionable feedback that
could be share with the teacher to improve her or his instruction. While
the auto-generated feedback is intended as a tool to help CSOs give more
effective guidance to teachers, it can be quite extensive and is not
prioritized. We were interested to know whether the CSOs make reference
to the application's auto-generated feedback when they hold their

not. We were interested to know whether the CSOs are leveraging this

    This result surfaces a few issues Tusome might consider addressing next
time CSOs receive a refresher training on Tangerine's use. 1. A lack of
awareness of how the information provided by the tablet (schools visited
and not visited) could be operationalized 1. A fear that they would be
accused of falsifying observation data, rooted specifically in a
misunderstanding of the application's GPS-capture functionality 1. A
mental compartmentalization of Tangerine as being a Tusome-specific
tool, not for use in broader contexts

Other reasons given suggest that the need which Tangerine might fill is
already being addressed separately. 1. The CSO keeps a personal record
(outside of the tablet) in which they track school visitation 1. The CSO
has prepared a work schedule, and uses that as their guide until the
month's activities have concluded.
