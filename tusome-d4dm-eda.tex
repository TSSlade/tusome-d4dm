    Here we begin exploring the data we obtained from interviewing the
teachers.

    Our dataset contains interviews with 828 teachers.

\subsubsection{Teachers visited previously by
CSOs}\label{teachers-visited-previously-by-csos}}

The underlying assumption of most of the interview protocol is that the
teacher has had a coaching interaction with a CSO. The first issue we
should then address is the proportion of teachers who have received a
visit from a CSO.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}

    We see that 7.37\% of teachers interviewed had never been previously
visited by CSOs.

    \hypertarget{number-of-coaching-visits-in-the-last-academic-term}{%
\subsubsection{Number of coaching visits in the last academic
term}\label{number-of-coaching-visits-in-the-last-academic-term}}

We have confirmed that the overwhelming majority of our teachers have
been visited. We can have greater confidence in the responses they give
us over the course of the interview if they have had a visit in the
recent past. We therefore asked the teachers to tell us how many times
they had been visited by their CSO in the preceding academic term (Term
2 of the Kenyan academic year, running from roughly May-July 2018).

    We see that roughly 11\% of the respondents, while they'd been visited
by a CSO in the past, had not been visited in the preceding term.
However, 64\% of the respondents were visited between once per term and
once per month. Roughly 28\% of the teachers were visited by their CSOs
more frequently than monthly.

\subsubsection{CSOs' activities during last coaching
visit}\label{csos-activities-during-last-coaching-visit}}

We are interested in knowing what CSOs are focusing on when they pay a
visit to a school. Are they observing a lesson? Are they giving feedback
to the teacher? Do they assess pupils' fluency rates? Do they take
advantage of their presence at the school to meet with the head teacher
(HT)? What kinds of things are they doing \emph{besides} these
activities?

    Nearly 90\% of teachers report that when the CSO last visited, s/he
provided feedback on a lesson. Nearly the same quantity said that the
CSO assessed pupils. Neither of these is surprising, as those activities
are key features of a ``reimbursable'' or ``valid'' lesson observation.
If anything, it is interesting that these numbers are not higher, given
that we have excluded from our denominator those teachers who said they
had never received a visit from the CSO.

Of note is the relatively low proportion of teachers reporting the CSO
had spoken with the HT. While Tusome encourages CSOs to speak with HTs
as part of the standard protocol for visiting a school, it is not
explicitly considered as a factor for reimbursement of transportation
costs for visiting that school.

That said, it is also possible that teachers may simply not be aware of
activities taking place outside of their classroom. They and their
classrooms would have been the objects of the lesson observation and
fluency assessment; they may not have as much visibility into what
happened before or after the CSO entered their classroom.

A little over 15\% of teachers reported the CSO conducted an activity
that was not listed in the questionnaire. Below we have sampled 20 of
the things that they reported which were not captured in the
questionnaire.

\subsubsection{CSOs using tablets or pen \& paper during
observation}\label{csos-using-tablets-or-pen-paper-during-observation}}

The \emph{Tangerine:Tutor} app was developed with the intent and belief
that CSOs would use it \emph{while observing} the lesson. However,
Tusome staff report that not all CSOs find the tablet interface
comfortable, and not all use it with ease. So we asked teachers to
report whether CSOs use the tablets during the lesson observation, and
also whether they use pen and paper.

    Roughly 90\% of teachers reported that the CSOs use tablets during
lesson observation; roughly 81\% of teachers reported the CSOs use pen
and paper during the lesson observation.

    We see that the overwhelming majority of CSOs are using both tablets
\emph{and} pen-and-paper systems when observing the teachers' lesson.
There have historically been some instruments/data that CSOs were tasked
by TSC to complete that were not rendered in \emph{Tangerine} format on
the tablets; as of midway through Term 3 of the 2018 academic year,
those instruments (mostly for the TSC's TPAD {[}Teacher Professional
Appraisal and Development{]} project) are now in \emph{Tangerine}. While
the use of pen and paper does not appear to have come at the expense of
using the tablets - indeed, it appears to be complementary, as nearly
all CSOs are using both - Tusome should nonetheless follow up on these
reports of CSOs' usage of pen and paper to understand the roots of the
practice.

\subsubsection{CSOs' usage of the tablets to assess pupils'
performance}\label{csos-usage-of-the-tablets-to-assess-pupils-performance}}

Tusome's coaching protocol requires CSOs to randomly select three
children from the classroom at the end of the lesson to assess their
reading fluency. The prompt the children are to read from is a laminated
sheet of paper with a short passage printed on it; the CSOs are
instructed to use the tablet to record the children's responses. The
tablet is then able to calculate fluency rates and store those as data
associated with that observation.

Approximately 88\% of the teachers reported that CSOs use the tablets to
assess children's reading fluency.

\subsubsection{Teachers' experience of feedback, and CSOs' use of
tablets}\label{teachers-experience-of-feedback-and-csos-use-of-tablets}}

Tusome asked teachers whether the CSO gave feedback on the lesson last
time s/he paid a visit, whether s/he used the tablet to do so, and
whether the teacher was able to recall specific feedback the CSO
provided.

\emph{When did you first receive a tablet from Tusome or PRIMR?}

We want to convert the year/month CSOs provided into a number so we can
work with it easily. We'll make the simplifying assumption that the
tablet was received on the first day of the month they provided, and
that this interview was conducted on the first day of the month. Neither
of those are true, but the marginal days are unlikely to make a
practical difference in a CSO's facility with the tool.

    We see that the majority of our CSOs have had their tablets for roughly
41 months (3.5 years). This is in keeping with the beginning of the
Tusome program, and is as expected. CSOs who have had their tablets for
longer are likely veterans of the PRIMR program (Tusome's predecessor);
those who have had tablets for fewer months may have assumed their roles
more recently. (CSO turnover due to retirement, promotion, maternity
leave, etc. is an issue which Tusome is constantly needing to manage.)

The CSOs' tablets come equipped with several tools meant to support

application, the
\href{http://schoolsnetkenya.com/tusome-early-literacy-programme-sounds-application/}{\emph{Papaya}}

books and teacher's guides), and videos that model effective
instructional delivery.

We are interested in which of those tools CSOs use, and how frequently.
We will provide an analysis of their unprompted free-response answers to
the question above. For the moment, we note the tools they said they use
when we explicitly prompted them with the list of tools available.

The \emph{Tangerine:Tutor} application analyzes the pattern of the CSO's

could be share with the teacher to improve her or his instruction. While
the auto-generated feedback is intended as a tool to help CSOs give more
effective guidance to teachers, it can be quite extensive and is not
prioritized. We were interested to know whether the CSOs make reference

not. We were interested to know whether the CSOs are leveraging this

    This result surfaces a few issues Tusome might consider addressing next
time CSOs receive a refresher training on Tangerine's use. 1. A lack of
awareness of how the information provided by the tablet (schools visited
and not visited) could be operationalized 1. A fear that they would be
accused of falsifying observation data, rooted specifically in a
misunderstanding of the application's GPS-capture functionality 1. A
mental compartmentalization of Tangerine as being a Tusome-specific
tool, not for use in broader contexts

Other reasons given suggest that the need which Tangerine might fill is
already being addressed separately. 1. The CSO keeps a personal record
(outside of the tablet) in which they track school visitation 1. The CSO
has prepared a work schedule, and uses that as their guide until the
month's activities have concluded.

    It appears that among the CSOs who check the application, it is most
common to check it at least weekly.
