# Analysis Plan for Tusome Data for Decision-Making Study

The proposed analyses are laid out below by instrument type.

## Teachers

Improving teachers' instructional practices is Tusome's main goal. It is their lesson delivery which is observed by CSOs; they are the recipients/key audience for the feedback generated by the _Tangerine:Tutor_.

Our analysis of the teacher data will include at least the following:

1. Calculate the proportion of teachers who have never been visited by CSOs. (`vis_before`)
2. Generate a histogram of the number of visits the teachers reported receiving in the last term. (`vis_before_freq`)
3. Generate a stacked bar chart of the activities teachers report CSOs' engaging in during their last visits.

```
vis_act_kids
vis_act_ht
vis_act_fdbk
vis_act_gen
vis_act_other
```

We will also include a sample of comments the teachers provided when responding 'other' (`vis_act_other_det`).

4. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting the CSOs used/did not use the tablets while observing a lesson. (`cso_usetab_yn`)
5. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting the CSOs used pen and paper while observing a lesson. (`cso_usepcl_yn`)
    + If the proportion of tablet use is low enough, it may be instructive to tabulate tablet use with pen-and-paper use.
7. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting the CSOs used the tablet to record the pupils' performance on a fluency assessment. (`cso_usetab_pup_yn`)
8. Generate a stacked bar chart of teachers reporting that during the last visit

|                          Prompt                          |       Variable       |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| + the CSO gave feedback on the lesson the teacher taught | `cso_gave_fdbk_yn`   |
| + the CSO used the tablet during the feedback session    | `cso_usetab_fdbk_yn` |
| + they could remember specific feedback the CSO provided | `cso_fdbk_remember`  |

...with samples of the specific feedback that teachers were able to recall from that last visit (`cso_fdbk_det`)

9. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting that the CSO ever showed them something directly on the tablet during a feedback sessions (`cso_fdbk_showtab_yn`)
10. Generate a stacked bar chart of the proportion of teachers reporting a CSO had shown them each of the following things on the tablet:

```
cso_shw_tips
cso_shw_fluency
cso_shw_video
cso_shw_lsnd
cso_shw_other
```

We will also include a sample of comments the teachers provided when responding 'other' (`cso_shw_other_det`).

11. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting that the CSO makes reference to feedback provided on an earlier visit when conducting a subsequent visit. (`cso_ref_prev_fdk_yn`)
12. Calculate the proportion of teachers saying that the CSO's feedback has helped improve their teaching skills with respect to literacy. (`cso_fdbk_better_tus`)
13. Calculate the proportion of teachers saying that the CSO's feedback has helped improve their teaching skills with respect to subjects other than literacy. (`cso_fdbk_better_nont`)
14. Show a sample of the specific examples of feedback that the CSO has provided to the teacher (`cso_fdbk_better_det`)
15. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting that CSOs specifically discuss the fluency levels of the children they assessed following the lesson (`cso_fdbk_discfluency`)
16. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting that they find it useful when the CSOs discuss the fluency levels of the children they assessed following the lesson (`cso_fdbk_flu_useful`)
17. Show a sample of the specific things teachers say they do with knowledge of their pupils' fluency (`cso_fdbk_flu_dowith`)
18. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting they find it distracting when the CSO uses a tablet during lesson observation (`cso_tab_distract_yn`) and during the feedback session (`cso_tab_fdbk_distrac`); if either is a significant proportion of teachers, sample the reported reasons why this is the case (`cso_tab_distract_why` , `cso_fdbk_tab_diswhy`)
19. For the subset of teachers who observed while the CSO assessed pupils' reading fluency with the tablet (`cso_pres_ass_tab`), calculate the proportion of teachers reporting that the students find it distracting when the CSO uses the tablet-based assessment (`cso_pup_dist_ass`). If it is significant, sample the reasons the teachers give for why this is the case (`cso_pup_why`)
20. Calculate the proportion of teachers reporting they assess their pupils' fluency levels (`tchr_ass_pup_yn`) and what tools they use to do so (`tchr_ass_pup_tools`)
21. Generate a stacked bar chart of the proportion of teachers saying they have access to a mobile phone (`tch_mob_phone`), that it is an Android (`tch_has_android`), and that they would use a tool on their mobile phone to do sample assessments with their students (`tch_wants_assess`).

## Curriculum Support Officers (CSOs)

Curriculum Support Officers (CSOs) are the key personnel in the _Tangerine:Tutor_ data generation and consumption loop. They carry the tablets on which the _Tangerine:Tutor_ app is loaded. They complete the _Tutor_ instruments while observing the teachers, review the feedback statements _Tutor_ provides at the end of each lesson, deliver their own feedback to teachers, and plan their coaching routing plans on the basis of teachers' and schools' performance.

Our analysis of the CSO data will include the following:

1. Convert `recd_tab_yr_` and `recd_tab_month` into a duration (in months) of active tablet usage.
2. A report showing the _proportion_ of respondents saying they use each of the tools (`freqapps_*` variables)

```
freqapps_tt_promp
freqapps_papaya_promp
freqapps_bks_promp
freqapps_vids_promp
```

3. A report showing the _proportion_ of respondents who refer to Tangerine for fedback (`ref_tang_fdbk`)
4. A report showing the _proportion_ of respondents who use Tangerine to plan their work (`ref_tang_nonobs`)
5. A stacked bar chart of users who use Tangerine to plan their work, by frequency of reference to the application (`freq_refer_tang_plan`)
6. A histogram of the number of times the CSOs looked at the Dashboard last term (`db_check_prevterm_freq`), faceted by whether they use Tangerine to plan (`ref_tang_nonobs`) and whether the County Director communicates about the Dashboard results (`cdir_comm_reres`)
7. A report of the proportion of CSOs whose County Director communicates about the Dashboard results (`cdir_comm_reres`)
8. A stacked bar chart of respondents saying their relationship has {improved|remained the same|deteriorated} for each coworker type
